# Neural_Networks
This is a GitHub repository containing various neural network models I have been working on. 

Neural networks are a type of machine learning algorithm that are modeled after the structure of the human brain. They are capable of learning complex patterns and making predictions based on input data, making them a powerful tool in many applications such as computer vision, natural language processing, and speech recognition.
